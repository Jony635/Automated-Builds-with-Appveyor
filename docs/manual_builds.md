### Manual Builds with Appveyor

---

#### 1. Sign in Appveyor and go [HERE](https://ci.appveyor.com/projects)
#### 2. Clic on New Project
#### 3. Select the repository where you want to generate a new build and choose Add
#### 4. Now we have to configure your project before starting builds. Choose settings option
#### 5. In this page you can configure the project. Do it the way you like more, but here we are interested in the Environment tab. Clic it.
#### 6. Select the right Build worker image. In my case I use Visual Studio 2017.
#### 7. Now you can compile virtually in Appveyor servers and check if your project has some errors.

After following those steps you will have all your project compiled in the Appveyor's servers.
