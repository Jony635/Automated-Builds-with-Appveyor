### Appveyor Notifications <br>

You can automate Appveyor notificate you when a new build is generated by 2 ways: Your project settings and [appveyor.yml](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/notifications/)
Here I will show you the first one.

#### Appveyor Notifications by Project Settings <br>

1. Go to YourProject->Settings->Notifications.
2. Add a new notification.

You can set a lot of ways to be notified by. I specially like **Email Notifications** and **Slack Notifications** (specially if I'm working in a team on the same project).
