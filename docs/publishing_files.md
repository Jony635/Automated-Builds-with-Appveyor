### ZIP Files + Github Releases

---

To achieve publishing a Github Release through Appveyor, we have to learn some new concepts.
First of all, Environments. They are the sites where you are going to publish the files to.

#### 1. Go [HERE](https://ci.appveyor.com/environments) and add a new one.
#### 2. Select your provider. In our case, Github Releases.
#### 3. Choose a name for the Environment, in order to you can understand easily which repository are you sending the files in.
